/src or /app

    /controllers: Contains logic to handle requests and responses. For instance, userController.js manages user-related actions like creating a new user, fetching user details, etc.

    /models: Defines the structure of the database entities. userModel.js could define a user with properties like username, email, and password.

    /routes: Sets up endpoints for the application and assigns controller functions to handle those endpoints. userRoutes.js might define routes for user registration and login.

    /services: Holds the business logic, often used by controllers to keep the code organized. userService.js might contain functions to encrypt passwords or verify user credentials.

    /middleware: Includes functions that run before the controllers. authMiddleware.js could check if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access certain routes.

    /utils or /helpers: Utility functions or helpers for common tasks across the application, like logger.js for logging and validators.js for input validation.

/config

    Contains files for configuration and environment settings. db.js configures the database connection, and index.js could export environment-specific settings.

/public

    Holds static files accessible to the public. This includes directories for images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files used in the client-side part of the application.

/views

    If your application serves HTML, this directory contains templates for your views. index.ejs and login.ejs could be templates for the homepage and login page, respectively.
